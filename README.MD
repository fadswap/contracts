## FADSwap Exchange
FADSwap is an decentralized exchange (DEX) opensource project for Binance Smart Chain (BSC).
  
The dapp will work like others DEX but will be fully governed by the community using the governance token ($FAD).
The specials feature of this DEX is listed below (not limited to the list):
- Community can vote for swap fee, slippage fees, referral commission, liquidity providers earned commission.
- Community can vote treasury and referral share
- Support of referral system
- Community can receive the GAS fees refund based on the amount of the token they stacked (share). 
- And more 

Most exchanges maintain an order book and facilitate matches between buyers and sellers.  
FADSwap smart contracts hold liquidity reserves of various tokens, and trades are executed directly against these reserves.   
Prices are set automatically using the constant product x * y = k market maker mechanism, which keeps overall reserves in relative 
equilibrium.  
Reserves are pooled between a network of liquidity providers who supply the system with tokens in exchange for a 
proportional share of transaction fees.

An important feature of FADSwap is the utilization of a factory contract that deploys a separate exchange contract 
for each BSC token contract. 
These exchange contracts each hold independent reserves of token pair. 
This allows trades between the token pair based on the relative supplies.
